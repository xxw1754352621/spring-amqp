The Spring AMQP project applies core Spring concepts to the development of AMQP-based messaging solutions.
We provide a "`template`" as a high-level abstraction for sending and receiving messages.
We also provide support for message-driven POJOs.
These libraries facilitate management of AMQP resources while promoting the use of dependency injection and declarative configuration.
In all of these cases, you can see similarities to the JMS support in the Spring Framework.
