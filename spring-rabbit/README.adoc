= spring-rabbit

This project provides the RabbitMQ implementation for the abstractions in `spring-amqp`.

Many of the integration tests here require a running RabbitMQ server - they
will be skipped if the broker is not detected.

If RabbitMQ is not installed on your system, refer to the instructions for your
particular OS here: [https://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html]

Start the server. For example, and a *nix-based system where RabbitMQ has been
installed within `/opt/rabbitmq`, issue the following command:

    > sudo /opt/rabbitmq/sbin/rabbitmq-server start
